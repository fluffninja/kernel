# Kernel

I'm making a kernel.

## Building and Running

Please double-check the prerequisites before trying anything :-)

To build and create a bootable floppy image, use `make image`.

To run (and build if not already built), use `make run`.

## Prerequisites

* make
* gcc
* nasm
* dd - to make a floppy image
* qemu - for quick emulation
